CSV to XLSX
-----------
Note: the CSV file needs to be in .csv format, if you have a file that is .numbers format,
      you need to export it to csv first.
      There are also online websites that does this job for free.

if on Windows: 
	(Executables are already generated for you)
	(if you ever wanted to generate new executables:
	open cmd at this folder and type: python generate_executables.py)

1- Run Installer.exe - to install all required libraries
2- Run Application.exe - to run the program
3- Provide the csv file path
4- Provide the Excel path
5- Hit Run, once file is completed
it will generate an updated excel file (in the same folder as original excel file)


if on Mac:
	(Executables need to be generated first - so you can delete 'Installer.exe' and 'Application.exe')
1- Open a terminal at this folder
2- type this command: python3 generate_executables.py
3- Two executable files will be generated 'Installer' and 'Application'
4- Run Installer - to install all required libraries
5- Run Application - to run the program
6- Provide the csv file path
7- Provide the Excel path
8- Hit Run, once file is completed
it will generate an updated excel file (in the same folder as original excel file)
